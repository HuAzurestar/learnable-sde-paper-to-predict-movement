# Paper source draft

This handoff contains parallel English and Chinese LaTeX sources for the
proposed paper repository.  The two files have matching section structure so
that a revision to one can be reviewed against the other.

## Proposed repository layout

```text
paper/
  en/main.tex       English source of record
  zh/main.tex       Chinese translation, kept section-for-section aligned
  figures/          source figures only; never trajectory images or samples
  tables/           aggregate, reviewed tables only
  references.bib    verified bibliographic records
```

`en/main.tex` is the source of record.  The Chinese document is a translation
draft, not an independent claim set.  Before submission, add only verified
references to `references.bib`, replace every marked placeholder with evidence
from a versioned run, and obtain data/privacy review for any aggregate result.

No dataset, checkpoint, trajectory, example coordinate, or experimental metric
is included in this handoff.
